QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile and many other projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself!

## Vision and Goals

### Simple setup

Setting up the first unit test with QUnit should be super simple, requiring as little setup as possible.

### Immediate, detailed feedback

When a test or assertion fails, QUnit should provide feedback to the developer as fast as possible, with enough detail to quickly figure out the underlying issue. And doing so without interrupting the test, as the other assertions still run.

### Also...

* Performance: QUnit is not only easy, but fast.
* Opinionated and lean API, but extensible.
* Compatible: It works on many different environments.

## QUnit Team

There's a lot of work that goes into making QUnit. Between API design, implementation, ticket triage, bug fixing, developer relations, infrastructure, and everything else, most of the work is done by volunteers.
